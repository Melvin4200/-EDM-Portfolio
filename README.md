## About Me
I am currently a first-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems, fueled by my passion for coding and problem-solving. With a solid foundation in C and growing proficiency in Python, I am exploring their application in software development, process automation, and efficient data management.

As I continue my academic journey, I am eager to expand my knowledge of programming, databases, and system analysis, with a goal of understanding how technology drives innovation. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can exchange ideas, contribute to projects, and refine my skills. Whether through coding challenges, hands-on projects, or future internships, I am always seeking opportunities to apply my learning and stay updated with emerging technologies.

Outside of academics, I love experimenting with new coding projects, keeping up with technological advancements, and broadening my expertise in software development. My ultimate goal is to build a strong foundation in Information Systems and contribute to innovative solutions that enhance efficiency and success in the tech industry. Iâ€™m excited for the journey ahead and the chance to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact in the world of technology.
